POSTGRES BUG: 
- when i find postgres, check for rhqadmin, if i fail, try to create it, otherwise fail
- if f16 postgresql-setup initdb on install..
- postgresql install failing... 
	HARDCODED 9.1-4 (.6 changes everything!)
	remove TODO fix me (3 of them?)
- installing postgres v9.2 fails
	does it not exist for fedora 15?
		if so, then throw error or don't include it as an option...
	otherwise, why not

TESTS:
- confirm deploy with/without eap_plugin works during install
- confirm deploy with/without eap_plugin works after install

- confirm start/stop postgres
- confirm install/uninstall postgres

- plugin and patches folders created in both jon and jon/jon-server-x.x.x
	utils.sh, line 440, does it ever come up as empty?
		2012-10-19, No.
	
- To confirm, re-build demo, does hello-world work from the first time?
	on first attempt, something failed in the eap start up (admin-console didn't work either) and had to restart...
	
-if /opt/jon-demo exists, it allows for the text "DD" to delete demo, but running it outputs:
	jon demo not installed, deleting is not an option

-if running ID script first time, without internet access, error thrown
	sed: can't read repopackages.php: no such file or directory
	
- create f16 vm to test
	- update systems deployed to, to cover f16 after:
	
- jboss deploy/undeploy functionality -- seems ok?
	something killed my node100 and node200 folders, clearing them out... 
	did unprovision remove the wrong thing somehow? check if it happens again
	had gone up to node400 but with node200 originally not started up, but normal...

VERIFY:
- installing node200 via gui (also cli?), fails to start up for some reason, and had default200 instead of ec-default200
- nsaadorkspaces/ nsaadWorkspaces/ being created by script??
- log level 3,4. any more inputs to change to takeInput?
	to many newLines, how to handle?
- deployment of patches may not work.  they will get deployed, but not really loaded till next restart of jon server (which is why i used to have two starts)
- is jboss user needed?
- on machine restart does jboss start up? if so demo start fails? or eap managed?
	none of the servers restart on laptop restart?
	install jon and agent as services -- is this necessary? do i want to change the chkconfig for jboss to not restart?

BUGS:
- if an rhq db exists, and you hit back, it deletes the original rhq, when really it shouldn't.. should only delete the appropriate db after choosing a db..
- sometimes - JBoss service won't start up from bundle (most likely resolved)

TODO:
- Make sure to add any new jboss port number in the correct order in the jboss_provioned var

- Event setup:
	under connection settings, turn on the event log that is there by default
	that's it, make sure to save the settings making the change

	cause an event (re-deploy app)

- Modify the metrics schedules for hello-world app to collect response times more regularly for nice graph

- if demo installed, but local data wiped, disallow until local build is deleted...
	otherwise, allow for different conf files depending on jd_folder location

- jon deploy app to non-platforms

- Re-do functions to allow for scripting of the script and no user input
- get rid of postgres jdbc dependency ?? in conf/jon/jon-server.x.x.x
- offer option to decide if you want demo components installed?
	yes, then create group, bundles, alerts, drift, etc..
	no, then just vanilla install
	
- re-organise functions logically
	string utils
	output / display utils
	jon server install
	jon server management
	jboss server install
	jboss server management
	cli specific
	bundle mgmt
	postgresql
	variable utils
	
- Add PPT specifying all the features installed in the demo
- upload CLI scripts separately into and pilhuhn's git project

FEATURES TO ADD:
- add sub-project menu?
	create bundle
	cli commands

- overload the installJONSilently method with a version that takes the variables pre-defined and calls the original method quietly... in prep for java bash caller

Add server (move from DB project)
Create addServer script
Called with server name
Instead of using auto import, it imports just that server
Adds it to temp group
Runs provision on that group
Moves server to new group

TO GET TO:
JON FEATURES
- Setup alerts and notifications via CLI
- Setup drift managements as per demo video
	http://mazz.fedorapeople.org/demos/drift/drift-basics.ogv
	http://mazz.fedorapeople.org/demos/drift/drift-pinning.ogv
	http://mazz.fedorapeople.org/demos/drift/drift-templates.ogv
	http://mazz.fedorapeople.org/demos/drift/drift-pinned-template.ogv
- set up log event processing
- Create users and roles with readonly, bundle manager, container manager, super admin (rhqadmin)
- RSS repos to show apps/platforms being updated via JON
- Setup SNMP trap listener, display traps received from JON
- Setup mail server and show emails sent via JON

DEMO ENHANCEMENTS
- export postgres db with monitoring info and option to reimport
- is there a way to have rhq property offer dropdown options (can you customise the form?)
- Generate bundle for basic Hello World war I created
- Increase load and show how JON can deploy more bundles/nodes into the cluster
- Setup bundle for EWS, ensure to turn on appropriate JMX properties in startup.sh for JON access
- Bundle all other JBoss products to deploy via JON
- Create proper load generating app that runs separately
	- Create bundle and deploy from JON
	- http://jakarta.apache.org/jmeter/ maybe
		(some JMeter references: http://www.softslate.com/blog/2011/08/functional-and-regression-testing-with-jmeter.html)

GUI
- Start a web interface that calls a scripter Java class?
- allow for installing more JBoss servers from the Install Menu
	provide a port (script should tell you what's installed, and not allow for re-installation or any lower port installs)
	provide number of servers
- provide a list of available applications to deploy... and the ones that are chosen, create bundles and deploy to local server
	(idea is to allow the deployment of dvd-store, the hello-world load generator, and potentially others later)
- allow for deployment of bundles separately from the main install (all demo bundles for example)

OTHER
- deal with all TODOs / Fixme / future
- test "statusall" in jboss_init_redhat.sh, if it works, copy to Resources/resources and Documents/Extra

TO TRY OUT
- Can you use targets?  Try with successful recipe to see if it breaks
- On "delete" targets?
- Can you add ant-contrib.jar to JON's ant bundle, and then use IFs?

MULTI-SERVER ENVIRONMENT
- (Possibility -- dead project?) Use boxgrinder to generate image with latest code
- Deploy from JON to separate servers (or into VMs), tell demo installer
	- single server env
	or
	- provide server ips/hostnames?
- Allow to pass in the IP/port for the JON server
	- If that is done, pass those into the initialSetup function for the jonAgent and replace them into the agent-configuration.xml file
- When installing agents, have a forked script that uses SSH and installs to a list of user provided servers, this would allow for installing to the agent to remote servers that can then be monitored (good for a VM scenario)
- Setup properties files to be used by bundle manager, to load properties and deploy EAP according to "environment"
